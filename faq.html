            Mahasarathi is not a ride-hailing service.
            We do not own vehicles, set fares, or control drivers.
            Instead, we act as a neutral mobility layer that integrates
            public transport (buses, metro, rail),
            semi-public transport (shared autos),
            and on-demand services.
          </p>
          <p>
            Think of Mahasarathi as the <strong>UPI of mobility</strong> —
            interoperable, neutral, and designed to work with everyone.

            Governments and RTCs gain a unified, real-time view of their
            transport systems without losing control.
            Mahasarathi helps improve service reliability,
            reduce losses, and plan capacity using data —
            without locking authorities into a single vendor.

          <p>
            Mahasarathi is both — and neither exclusively.
            At its core, it is an integration platform.
            Governments, operators, and private apps
            can all plug into the same interoperable layer,
            while commuters benefit from a unified experience.

            We are designing for national adoption.
            Initial pilots focus on tier-1 metros
            (Delhi, Bengaluru, Mumbai, and Hyderabad),
            followed by tier-2 and tier-3 cities
            where coordination gaps are often greatest.

            Yes. Mahasarathi is aligned with India’s

            Mahasarathi is currently in the R&amp;D and pilot phase.
            We are actively collaborating with city authorities,
            operators, and partners to roll out
            phased deployments across regions.
